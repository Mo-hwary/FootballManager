## ‚úÖ Validation Rules

- Team name must be unique
- Player position must be one of:
  `Goalkeeper`, `Defender`, `Midfielder`, `Forward`
- Scores and stats (goals, minutes) must be non-negative
- Proper validation for nulls, formats, and constraints

---

## üß™ Testing

This project includes **unit tests** for:

- Controllers
- Services
- Business logic
- Error handling

To run all tests:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Tests are located in:

```
FootballManager.Tests/
```

---

## üìå Assumptions Made

- A match can exist even if one of the teams is deleted (FK set to `null`)
- Player statistics are only tied to existing matches and players
- No authentication is implemented for simplicity

---

## ‚ú® Bonus Ideas (Not Implemented)

- JWT Authentication
- Pagination on list endpoints
- Global exception handling middleware
- Caching (e.g., for `GetAllTeams`)
- Logging (via Serilog or built-in)
